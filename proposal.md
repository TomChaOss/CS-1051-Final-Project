# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Insulin Dosage Calculator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The user will be able to input their blood glucose and the grams of carbohydrates that they will consume, and the calculator will output a number of insulin units.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The first step is to ask the user for their insulin to carb ratio, their correction factor, their target blood glucose. Once we have those parameters, the program will prompt the user to enter their blood sugar
and the grams of carbohydrates that they are going to ingest, and finally it will use all of the previous values to calculate an insulin shot. The program will also include a graph or histogram displaying each bolus (aka insulin shot), which will be composed of the blood glucose reading, the carbs, and the total insulin delivered.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Classmate #1: Jayden, jayden.millwood@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki sections 002/004.
Classmate #2: Daniel Samsonov, daniel.samsonov@temple.edu, Xinwen Zhang sections 001/003.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1. Define an insulin to carb ratio, a correction factor, and a target blood glucose.
2. Ask the user for their current blood glucose and the grams of carbs that they are going to consume.
3. Once the program gets the previous 2 values, it will calcucate and display the total amount of insulin units.
4. The registered carbs and blood glucose, as well as the total units for the shot will be stored in a list (or multiple lists), and that data will be used to build as graph.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. The program will prompt the user for their insulin to carb ratio, correction factor, and target blood glucose.
2. Once the program gets those parameters, it will ask the user for their current blood glucose and the grams of carbs that they are going to consume.
3. If the current blood glucose is too low, the program will warn the user about it and will re-prompt for a new glucose reading.
4. Once the program gets the previous 2 values, it will calcucate and display the insulin dosage for the carbs, the blood glucose correction, and the total amount of insulin units.
5. The registered carbs and blood glucose, as well as the total units for the shot will be stored in a list (or multiple lists), and that data will be used to build as graph.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. The program will prompt the user for their insulin to carb ratio, correction factor, and target blood glucose, which it will then save
2. Once the program gets those parameters, it will ask the user for their current blood glucose and the grams of carbs that they are going to consume.
3. If the current blood glucose is too low, the program will warn the user about it and will re-prompt for a new glucose reading.
4. Once the program gets the previous 2 values, it will calcucate and display the insulin dosage for the carbs, the blood glucose correction, and the total amount of insulin units.
5. The registered carbs, blood glucose, and the total insulin units will be stored in a list (or multiple lists), and the program will ask the user if they want to calculate another insulin shot.
6. If the user decides to calculate another shot , the program will return the output of step 4, and this new output will be added/saved to the previously mentioned list(s).
7. If the user doesn't want to calculate another insulin shot, the program will display a graph/histogram consisting of the logged grams of carbs, glucose, and total insulin units.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to do more research on building graphs as that is something I struggle with. Additionally, I will also need to improve my abilities on creating and modifying files. when it comes to the division of work, we haven't decided yet, but we each plan to colaborate 1/3 to each step of the process.
